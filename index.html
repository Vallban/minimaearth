            <h3 id="Who">Who are we?</h3>
                <p>Minima Earth was created by some online friends during March 2025, a joint work in which each of us has
                    helped on something developing this project.
                </p>
                <p>Regardless, those who play that where not here during the first days share some common values; all of us
                    are leisurely Minecraft enjoyers that are additionally interested in diplomacy, estrategy and mpires
                    roleplay
